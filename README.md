## Download the entire session videos

To download every available session video of 2015, go to settings and klick the "Download All Videos" button.

## El Capitan support

Almost everything works fine on El Capitan, but live ~~sessions currently only play the audio, this seems to be a bug in AVFoundation and I'm currently trying to fix it~~. I've managed to get live streamed sessions working on El Capitan by using a custom player view, but I've not had the time to implement complete controls (volume, scrubbing, etc). 

## Searching

You can perform an advanced search using the qualifiers "year", "focus", "track", "downloaded" and "description".

Example searches:

	year:2013 focus:ios scroll

	year:2014 track:frameworks cocoa

	track:frameworks core
	
	year:2014 downloaded:yes
	
	description:iwork
	
## Sharing

You can share direct links to specific session videos. Just select the session on the list and âŒ˜C to copy It's URL, or use the right-click menu. For instance, [this link](wwdc://2014/101) opens up the 2014 keynote.

## Reading

WWDC for OS X is integrated with [ASCIIWWDC](http://asciiwwdc.com), so you can see and search through transcripts of the sessions while watching the videos.
